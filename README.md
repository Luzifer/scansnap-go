# Luzifer / scansnap-go

`scansnap-go` is a small webserver connecting to a SANE enabled scanner exposing the scan result as a PDF over HTTP.

Default settings are set to use A4 pages from a Fujitsu ScanSnap ix500 with Duplex scan enabled. These are quite specific settings you might want to change in case you want to use this software yourself.
